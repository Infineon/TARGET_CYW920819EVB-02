# CYW920819EVB-02

### Overview

The Cypress CYW920819EVB-02 Evaluation Kit enables you to evaluate and develop single-chip Bluetooth applications using the CYW20819, an ultra-low-power dual-mode Bluetooth 5.0 wireless MCU device. The CYW20819 is a stand-alone baseband processor with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting BR/EDR/BLE. Manufactured using advanced CMOS low-power process, the CYW20819 employs high integration to reduce external components, thereby minimizing the deviceâ€™s footprint and cost. This kit helps evaluate device functionality and develop applications quickly for faster time-to-market. CYW20819 supports Bluetooth SIG-certified Mesh v1.0. CYW20819EVB-02 can also be used to develop BLE Mesh applications on CYW20819 device using ModusToolbox.

* 62-FBGA CYW20819 Bluetooth 5.0-compliant Bluetooth/BLE wireless MCU
* Arduino compatible headers for hardware expansion
* On-board sensors - a 9-axis motion sensor (3D digital linear acceleration sensor, 3D digital angular rate sensor, and 3D digital magnetic sensor) and a thermistor
* User switch and LEDs
* USB connector for power, programming and USB-UART bridge

### Power Estimator Library
Power Estimator library provides an estimate of power consumed by a CYW920819EVB-02 device. Follow the below mentioned steps to get power estimation of the device:

Step 1: Enable Power Estimator Library add the following in application makefile:

```
	POWER_ESTIMATOR=1
	CY_APP_DEFINES += -DWICED_POWER_LOGGER_ENABLE
	COMPONENTS += wpl_lib
```
Step 2: Launch Power Estimator Tool from ModusToolbox 2.0 IDE on the host machine:


* To run the tool: Select CYW920819EVB-02 application -> Select Project Tab -> Select ModusToolbox -> Select Power Estimator


* To get Power Esimator User Guide: In the tool go to Help -> View Help


* The platform power estimator database file is available at:  `wiced_btsdk\bsp\TARGET_CYW920819EVB-02\COMPONENT_wpl_lib\20819A1\wpl_power_data\CYW920819EVB_02.xml`
