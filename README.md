# CYW920819EVB-02

### Overview

The Cypress CYW920819EVB-02 Evaluation Kit enables you to evaluate and develop single-chip Bluetooth applications using the CYW20819, an ultra-low-power dual-mode Bluetooth 5.2 wireless MCU device. The CYW20819 is a stand-alone baseband processor with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting Bluetooth LE/BR/EDR. Manufactured using advanced CMOS low-power process, the CYW20819 employs high integration to reduce external components, thereby minimizing the deviceâ€™s footprint and cost. This kit helps evaluate device functionality and develop applications quickly for faster time-to-market. CYW20819 supports Bluetooth SIG-certified Mesh v1.0. CYW20819EVB-02 can also be used to develop Bluetooth LE Mesh applications on CYW20819 device using ModusToolbox.

* 62-FBGA CYW20819 dual-mode (LE/BR/EDR) Bluetooth 5.2-compliant wireless MCU
