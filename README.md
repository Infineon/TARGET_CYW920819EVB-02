# CYW920819EVB-02

### Overview

The Cypress CYW920819EVB-02 Evaluation Kit enables you to evaluate and develop single-chip Bluetooth applications using the CYW20819, an ultra-low-power dual-mode Bluetooth 5.2 wireless MCU device. The CYW20819 is a stand-alone baseband processor with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting Bluetooth LE/BR/EDR. Manufactured using advanced CMOS low-power process, the CYW20819 employs high integration to reduce external components, thereby minimizing the deviceâ€™s footprint and cost. This kit helps evaluate device functionality and develop applications quickly for faster time-to-market. CYW20819 supports Bluetooth SIG-certified Mesh v1.0. CYW20819EVB-02 can also be used to develop Bluetooth LE Mesh applications on CYW20819 device using ModusToolbox.

* 62-FBGA CYW20819 dual-mode (LE/BR/EDR) Bluetooth 5.2-compliant wireless MCU
* Arduino compatible headers for hardware expansion
* On-board sensors - a 9-axis motion sensor (3D digital linear acceleration sensor, 3D digital angular rate sensor, and 3D digital magnetic sensor) and a thermistor
* User switch and LEDs
* USB connector for power, programming and USB-UART bridge

### Power Estimator Library
Power Estimator library provides an estimate of power consumed by a CYW920819EVB-02 device. Follow the below mentioned steps to get power estimation of the device:

Step 1: Enable Power Estimator Library add the following in application makefile:

```
	POWER\_ESTIMATOR=1
	CY\_APP\_DEFINES += -DWICED\_POWER\_LOGGER\_ENABLE
	COMPONENTS += wpl\_lib
```
Step 2: Launch Power Estimator Tool from ModusToolbox 2.0 IDE on the host machine:


* To run the tool: Select CYW920819EVB-02 application -> Select Project Tab -> Select ModusToolbox -> Select Power Estimator


* To get Power Esimator User Guide: In the tool go to Help -> View Help


* The platform power estimator database file is available at:  `wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\TARGET\_CYW920819EVB-02\COMPONENT\_wpl\_lib\20819A1\wpl\_power\_data\CYW920819EVB\_02.xml`

### Additional Information

Cypress also offers a purpose-built Bluetooth mesh kit that comes with four boards and several on-board sensors to implement more complete mesh application without any external hardware.
