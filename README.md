# CYW920819EVB-02

### Overview

The Infineon CYW920819EVB-02 Evaluation Kit enables you to evaluate and develop single-chip Bluetooth&#174; applications using the CYW20819, an ultra-low-power dual-mode Bluetooth&#174; 5.2 wireless MCU device. The CYW20819 is a stand-alone baseband processor with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting Bluetooth&#174; LE/BR/EDR. Manufactured using advanced CMOS low-power process, the CYW20819 employs high integration to reduce external components, thereby minimizing the deviceâ€™s footprint and cost. This kit helps evaluate device functionality and develop applications quickly for faster time-to-market. CYW20819 supports Bluetooth&#174; SIG-certified Mesh v1.0. CYW20819EVB-02 can also be used to develop Bluetooth&#174; LE Mesh applications on CYW20819 device using ModusToolbox&#8482;.

* 62-FBGA CYW20819 dual-mode (LE/BR/EDR) Bluetooth&#174; 5.2-compliant wireless MCU
* Arduino compatible headers for hardware expansion
* On-board sensors - a 9-axis motion sensor (3D digital linear acceleration sensor, 3D digital angular rate sensor, and 3D digital magnetic sensor) and a thermistor
* User switch and LEDs
* USB connector for power, programming, and USB-UART bridge
